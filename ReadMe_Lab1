Lab 1

Reads in a value from port 0x01.
This value is the number worked with (Num).
The number can have a value from 0‐>255 (unsigned decimal).

Read in a value from port 0x02.
This value serves as the option selector

Options

0. End the program

1. Determine if the number is odd or even.
    -If Odd
        Print the value of 0x01 to port 0x01
    -If Even
        Print the value of 0x02 to port 0x01
        
2. Determine if the number is prime.
    -If Prime
        Print the value of 0x01 to port 0x02
    -If Not Prime
        Print the value of 0x02 to port 0x02
        
3. Determine if the number is perfect.
    -If Perfect
        Print the value of 0x01 to port 0x03
    -If Not Perfect
        Print the value of 0x02 to port 0x03
        
4. Determine the value in the Fibonacci sequence of the number’s position
    Printed Number is sent to port 0x04
      -If the Output number would be larger then 255, 255 is printed instead. 
      
5. Determine the value of the number if its bits are reversed.
    Print to 0x05
    
6. Determine the result of a division operation.
    Accepts a number from port 0xFF (divisor)
    Divides the original number by that amount
    -If divisor is greater then Num
      Print 255 to port 0x06
      Print 255 to port 0x07
    -If the divisor is less then or equal to Num
      Print the quotient to port 0x06
      Print the remainder to port 0x07
      
7. Choose your own operation
  send the result to port 0x08
  
After each option the user is redirected back to the menu.
